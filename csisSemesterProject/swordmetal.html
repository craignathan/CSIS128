                            to make for decorative swords. The reason stainless steel is used for decorative swords is becuase any blad over 12" long is considered to be
                            to brittle for any real usage. However, if used as a practice sword with not contact with anything hard it will work. Stainless Steel gets it's name from the
                            high Chromium content which gives its Stainless ability. The Chromium content of stainless steel is usually over 11%.</td>

                            that it is between .01 and .99% carbon. For sword's there are 3 main types of steel used 1045, 1060, 1095 carbon steel. While using carbon steel the most ideal range of carbon content
